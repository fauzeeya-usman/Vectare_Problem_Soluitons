# Project Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to several Project Euler problems. Below are the solutions to the specified problems:

## 1 - Solution_One: Multiples of 3 and 5

**Problem:** If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**Solution:**
The code snippet for this problem checks each number below 1000 and adds it to the sum if it's divisible by 3 or 5.

## 2 - Solution_Two: Even Fibonacci Numbers

**Problem:** Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Solution:**
In this problem, the code generates Fibonacci numbers and adds the even ones to the sum until a certain limit is reached.

## 3 - Solution_Three: Largest Palindrome Product

**Problem:** A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

**Solution:**
The code snippet for this problem checks all products of two 3-digit numbers and identifies the largest palindrome among them.

## 4 - Solution_Four: Smallest Multiple

**Problem:** 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

**Solution:**
In this problem, the code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of a range of numbers.

## 5 - Solution_Five: 10,001st Prime

**Problem:** By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10,001st prime number?

**Solution:**
The code snippet uses a prime generation algorithm to find the 10,001st prime number.

## 6 - Solution_Six: Lattice Paths

**Problem:** Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner. How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

**Solution:**
The code calculates the number of routes through a grid using dynamic programming techniques.

## 7 - Solution_Seven: Maximum Path Sum

**Problem:** By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. Find the maximum total from top to bottom in `triangle.txt`, a text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

**Solution:**
In this problem, the code reads the triangle from the text file and calculates the maximum path sum using a bottom-up approach.
